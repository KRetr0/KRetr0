# 👋 Hello, I'm Efe

I'm a high school senior studying Aircraft Maintenance Technology and currently completing an internship in the aviation field. While my academic background is in aviation, my true passion lies in technology — especially in programming, game development, and artificial intelligence.

In my free time, I explore programming languages, build small projects, and experiment with new ideas. I'm particularly interested in how games are built from scratch, how systems interact at the network level, and how AI can be used creatively in both gameplay and automation.
